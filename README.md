# ProCoach Landing Page Implementation

This project is a front-end development practice exercise, bringing a visually appealing landing page design to life. The goal was to recreate a design sourced from a Dribbble image, focusing on clean code, modern UI components, and engaging animations.

## üöÄ About the Project

This project served as a valuable opportunity to hone front-end development skills by:

- Translating a static visual design (from a Dribbble image) into a fully functional web interface without access to original design files.
- Practicing component-based UI development with React and Radix UI.
- Implementing smooth animations and transitions using Framer Motion.
- Focusing on modern layout principles using Radix UI and styled components.
- Creating a responsive and visually engaging landing page.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- React
- Radix UI
- Framer Motion
- styled-components

## ‚ú® Features

- Fully responsive design, adapting to various screen sizes.
- Interactive elements and animations powered by Framer Motion.
- Structured with reusable UI components built with Radix UI.
- Modern and clean layout based on the provided Dribbble design.
- Styled with the flexibility and power of styled-components.

## üß† What I Learned

- Practical application of React for building dynamic user interfaces.
- Implementing and styling Radix UI components to create accessible and robust UI elements.
- Adding fluid animations and micro-interactions with Framer Motion.
- The process of interpreting a visual design from an image and translating it into code, including making decisions on spacing, typography, and responsiveness without explicit specifications.
- The importance of pixel-perfect (or near-perfect) implementation when working from a visual reference.

The visual design for this landing page was inspired by and implemented based on an image found on Dribbble. This project focused purely on the front-end implementation of that design.
